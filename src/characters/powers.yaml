BindingOfFive: |
  My maximum Aether Current dice increases to 5, but my maximum HP is
  reduced by -5 as well.
BloodSeals: |
  The first time I'm _injured_ in each combat encounter while hosting an
  Invocation, I immediately regain up to 2 spent AC dice and roll them to
  generate seals.
ChoirOfBenediction: |
  When I use my **_Chant of Eld_ Minor Action** while hosting a Speaker, the
  Speaker echoes the chant. Increase Barrier gained by +1 and the range to
  1. At levels 3 & again at 9 the Heal effect is also improved by +1.
ClosedCircuit: |
  When I use an Arcanum power I can choose to Sacrifice 5 HP in order to
  reduce its seal cost to 1. At level 3 the HP Sacrifice required is reduced to 3.
CosmicBond: |
  When I spend my last Seal, I roll a d6. If its result is the same type of
  number as the last seal spent (even numbers for Astral Seals, odd
  numbers for Umbral Seals), I am refunded the spent seal. This can only
  happen once per Invocation hosted.
FleshOfLegends: |
  Whenever I host a new Invocation, I gain SHIELDED.
InTheArmsOfAngels: |
  I can fly at will. Any movement I take can be flight instead of its normal
  movement type.
Keymaster: |
  Whenever I use an Invocation power, I can teleport 1 either before or after
  resolving the power.
Medicus: |
  Whenever I heal an ally with an action costing Recovery, myself & all other
  allies not healed by the power Heal 2. This amount increases by +1 at level
  3 and again at level 9.
OccultPriest: |
  I am an ordained & recognized priest of a religion. This counts as a **trait** for
  all rolls related to fulfilling my role as an intermediary between the higher
  emanations and the physical world, and for dispensing religious
  teachings and performing rituals.
ProtectiveEidolons: |
  While I'm hosting an Invocation, I gain +1 to both Dodge & Ward, and +1 on
  Soak rolls.
SealsOfLife: |
  I heal 3 once per turn when I spend one or more Seals. At level 3 I also
  gain Barrier 1.
ShatteredSeals: |
  I can shatter a seal as a free action on my turn, granting me additional
  esoteric power immediately, but straining my connection to the cosmic
  aether. A shattered seal acts as either an Astral or Umbral Seal (I choose
  which), but once spent, my maximum number of AC dice is reduced by -1
  until the end of the encounter. I can only shatter one seal per round. This
  is considered a blasphemous act by many religions' clergies, and those
  schooled in magicks are likely to be appalled by the sensation of the
  rancid aether seeping from a shattered seal.
StarryDivinations: |
  Once per session, I can declare that I've received a vision or divination
  from the almagest about a particular place or person. The GM will tell me
  3 secrets about the subject, at least one of which should be to my
  immediate benefit.
SermonsAndStories: |
  When we take a long rest, I can spin tales from threads of spirit magick to
  invigorate the soul. My allies and I can choose to either regain an
  additional +5 HP from the rest, regain an extra point of Recovery, or
  remove the stressed status from one bond.
TempleKnight: |
  When wielding a melee weapon, I gain +4 Armor HP and may grant
  Barrier 1 to any ally in my zone once per round when I inflict damage with
  a melee Basic Attack action. At level 3, the Armor HP bonus increases to
  +6. At level 9 the Barrier increases to Barrier 2.
UnravelingRapids: |
  My damaging Invocation powers inflict +3 damage against undead,
  daemons, summoned creatures, and anything else that's from a different
  emanation or plane of existence.
WarriorPriest: |
  I do not suffer the first instance of the stacking damage penalty for using
  multiple actions with the Attack tag in the same round, but the penalty
  still accrues. For instance, if I use two attacks, neither suffers the penalty,
  and if I use three attacks, the third only suffers a -2 penalty. This doesn't
  stack with similar effects which allow me to ignore this penalty.
CosmicSiphon: |
  The Astromancer creates a surging darkness, an echo of the utterblack between the
  stars. This gnawing void tears at the aether of their foes to bolster their own.
